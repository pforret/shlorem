bash script / project creator

## ‚è≥ TL;DR

to create a new stand-alone **SCRIPT** (just a xyz.sh script), with option parsing, color output (cf `1.`)

        bashew.sh script
    
to create a new standalone script **PROJECT** (in a folder, with README) (cf `2.`)

        bashew.sh project

to initialize a bashew-based **REPO** with CI/CD you just cloned (cf `3.`)

        bashew init
     
## üéØ Features

* contained in 1 single file (no external dependencies)
* comes with `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, ... markdown files
* edit only main() function and subroutines in beginning of script, all template code is at the end of the script
* definition of flags/options/parameters in 1 place only
* definition of dependencies (like curl, ffmpeg, imagemagick...) in 1 place only
* automatic creation of usage text based on definition above
* short/long option parsing, based on definition above
* several functions for output to stdout/stderr, with intelligent color usage (not when output is piped)
* reads a .env configuration file, if there is one
* predefined quiet (no output) and verbose (more output) modes
* folder for temporary files (with automatic cleanup)
* folder for log files (with automatic cleanup)
* easy CI/CD for Github (with shellcheck)
* correct determination of script installation folder (resolve symbolic links)
* see [features.md](doc/features.md) for detailed information

### 1. create new bash script (without repo)
```shell
bashew.sh script                    # will interactively ask for author & script details
bashew.sh -f script                 # will create new script with random name
bashew.sh -f -n "../list.sh" script # will create new script ../list.sh
```

Example:
```shell
$ bashew.sh -f script
‚Ä¶  Creating script ./towel_nappers.sh ...
./towel_nappers.sh

$ bashew.sh -f -q script
./iffiest_prepays.sh
```

### 2. create new bash project folder/repo (with README.md, CI/CD)
```shell
bashew.sh project               # will interactively ask for author & script details
bashew.sh -f project            # will create new project with random name
bashew.sh -f -n "tango" project # will create new project in folder "tango"
```

Example:

    > bashew.sh -f project
    ‚Ä¶  Creating project ./tendon_mingle ...
    CHANGELOG.md README.md VERSION.md LICENSE .gitignore tendon_mingle.sh bitbucket-pipelines .github/workflows  
    ‚úî  next step: 'cd ./tendon_mingle' and start scripting!
  
### 3. create a bash script repo, with CI/CD, with README, with tests, with versioning ... 

* on [github.com/pforret/bashew](https://github.com/pforret/bashew), click on '**Use this template**'
* then clone your new repo
```shell
git clone https://github.com/<you>/<your repo>.git
cd <your repo>
./bashew.sh init             # will ask for details and initialise/clean up the repo
```

#### and then, if you have [setver.sh](https://github.com/pforret/setver):
```shell
setver push          # will commit and push new code
setver new patch     # will set new version to 0.0.1
setver set 1.0.0     # when your first working version is committed
```
  
### 4. git clone into new repo
```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/pforret/bashew.git <newname>
cd <newname>
./bashew.sh init             # will ask for details and iniialise/clean up the repo
```
